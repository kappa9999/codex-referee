# Start Here

This file is the entrypoint for any new Codex session.

## Objective

Build Codex Referee as a unique, defensible product for individual ChatGPT Pro users.

## User Constraints (Mandatory)

- Product must be useful for fun projects and random tasks, not just enterprise teams.
- If a concept area is crowded, pivot to a more unique angle.
- Implementation stack is locked to TypeScript.
- Endgame optimization mandate is active: no shortcuts.
- Rule source: `docs/product/ENDGAME-OPTIMIZATION-MANDATE.md` and `references/optimization-policy.json`.

## Current Candidate

- Name: Codex Referee.
- Core function: run multiple Codex strategies in parallel on same task, score patches with objective gates, pick winner, and learn from user accept/reject outcomes.

## Required Session Behavior

1. Keep all updates in this workspace so context survives session resets.
2. Log every meaningful decision in `docs/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`.
3. Add every web source to `docs/research/SOURCE-LOG.md` with date and claim.
4. Update `docs/handoff/01-CURRENT-STATE.md` before ending any work session.
5. Rewrite `docs/handoff/02-NEXT-PROMPT.md` with exact next command for the following session.
6. Enforce endgame optimization rule. No shortcut implementation without documented replacement plan.

## Fast Start Checklist

1. Confirm open tasks in `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md`.
2. Confirm policy in `docs/product/ENDGAME-OPTIMIZATION-MANDATE.md`.
3. Continue the highest-priority planning or build task.
4. Before ending, run `docs/handoff/SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md`.
