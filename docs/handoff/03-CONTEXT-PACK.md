# Context Pack

Use this file when a new Codex session has zero prior context.

## Project in One Paragraph

This workspace exists to evaluate and build a unique product for ChatGPT Pro + Codex users. The current candidate is Codex Referee: a system that executes multiple strategies for the same coding task, scores outputs objectively, and recommends the best patch while learning from user outcomes.

## Why This Exists

Generic remote control ideas for coding agents appear increasingly crowded. The working strategy is to target selection quality and merge confidence instead of another chat/remote shell surface.

## Read Order for New Sessions

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/handoff/00-START-HERE.md`
3. `docs/handoff/01-CURRENT-STATE.md`
4. `docs/research/COMPETITOR-LANDSCAPE.md`
5. `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md`
6. `docs/handoff/02-NEXT-PROMPT.md`

## Non-Negotiable Continuity Rules

1. Update `docs/handoff/01-CURRENT-STATE.md` at end of session.
2. Append sources to `docs/research/SOURCE-LOG.md` for every external claim.
3. Append decisions to `docs/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`.
4. Keep backlog status current.

## Definition of Progress

A session counts as progress only if at least one of these happened:

- competitor matrix improved with cited evidence,
- concept refined with explicit go/no-go logic,
- MVP spec advanced with executable next tasks.
