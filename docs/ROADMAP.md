# Roadmap

Public roadmap for Codex Referee.

## Now (Alpha)

- End-to-end `referee run` flow is working:
- isolated strategy worktrees
- candidate evaluation and ranking
- winner recommendation with artifacts

## Next

1. Add run history persistence and indexing.
2. Implement `inspect`, `accept`, and `feedback` commands.
3. Add learning loop from accept/reject outcomes.
4. Improve scoring with task-aware weighting and clearer confidence bands.

## Later

1. Better report UX for non-technical users.
2. Optional local dashboard for browsing historical runs.
3. Team-friendly sharing of run reports and decisions.
